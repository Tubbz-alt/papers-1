\section{Architecture}
In our system we have a set of classes which are central to the 
game. Those classes handle theming, player actions, game logic 
and the graphical representation of the game. These central
classes of our game are depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:architecture}.

The first instanciated class is FBGame. FBGame controls the game logic, 
like the number of players, reward strategies like highscores and the
conditions of victory and defeat. FBGame is also responsible for instanciating
the FBWorld class which encapsulates graphical representation of the game.
