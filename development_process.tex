\section{Development Process}
Our development roadmap scheduled three successive releases. The first release, called ``Waitaha'', was developed using the pair programming technique: While one developer was typing code at least one other developer was constantly watching and reviewing it. This version was the first basic clone of the original Frozen Bubble game.

``Little Blue'' was the second release and the first one to be presented to the public, featuring a restructered architecture and a stable API. With this version there was a shift in development with each of the developers encountered a shift in programming techniques: Less pair programming but heavy reliance on version control (Monticello and Git) and frequent meetings for code review.

The final version - ``Rockhopper'' - is considered feature complete and has no known bug\footnote{at the time of writing}.
