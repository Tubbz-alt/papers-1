\section{Development Process}
Our development roadmap scheduled three successive releases. The first release, called ``Waitaha'', was developed using the pair programming technique: While one developer was typing code at least one other developer was constantly watching and reviewing it. This version was the first basic clone of the original Frozen Bubble game.
