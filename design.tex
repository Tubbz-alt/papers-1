\section{Design Process}
\subsection{Simple Multiplayer Mode}
%
Several problems occured when we implemented a simple local multiplayer mode. In this chapter, we will discuss the most important design decissions.

  \item[problem] ~\\ \hfill
    Players need to be informed of critical actions happening in other players' playfields 
  \item[possible solutions] \hfill

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Direct communication between playfields
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Advantages: A simple solution like that could be implemented easily and only the most rudimentary communication is needed, so there is  very few overhead.
        \item Disadvantages: This is not an object-oriented solution and playfield would need to be hardcodedly enumerated, making the code hardly maintainable and badly extensibly. 
      \end{itemize}

      \item Delegating communication through a mediator
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Advantages: A mediator makes very maintainable and expandable code. Other than the previous proposal, this is indeed an object-oriented take on the problem.
        \item Disadvantages: There is more than twice as much communication happening as in the simplified solution.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

  \item[Chosen Solution] ~\\ \hfill
    We chose the latter proposal, a mediator.
  \\

  \item[problem] ~\\ \hfill
    Different playfields have to be controlled by different players. And, of course, different playfields have to exist in the first place.
  \item[possible solutions] \hfill

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Introducing an Abstract Factory for playfields, implementing several behavioural patterns.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Advantages: Abstract Factories are extensible and object-oriented.
        \item Disadvantages: This might be a little confusing, as there has to be a whole lot of new code and new classes.
      \end{itemize}

      \item All playfields are similar and manage their behaviour on their own.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Advantages: No new codes needs to be introduced in this solution...
        \item Disadvantages: ... but the generic playfield might have to be extended for proper multiplayer use.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
