\subsection{Simple Multiplayer Mode}
%
Several problems occured when we implemented a simple local multiplayer mode.

\begin{itemize}
%
  \item problem: Players need to be informed of critical actions happening in other players' playfields 
  \item possible solutions:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Direct communication between playfields
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Advantages: A simple solution like that could be implemented easily and only the most rudimentary communication is needed, so there is  very few overhead.
        \item Disadvantages: This is not an object-oriented solution and playfield would need to be hardcodedly enumerated, making the code hardly maintainable and badly extensibly. 
      \end{itemize}

      \item Delegating communication through a mediator
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Advantages: A mediator makes very maintainable and expandable code. Other than the previous proposal, this is indeed an object-oriented take on the problem.
        \item Disadvantages: There is more than twice as much communication happening as in the simplified solution.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
