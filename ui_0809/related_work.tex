As far as we are aware of, there is no effort undergo to create something similar to our device. There are,
however, a number of options available for using a social network mobilly, the most generic of which is the 
sub-notebook. While those are still fairly expensive, their small brothers, the netbooks, are not. Of course,
both are still very large, have comparatively low running times and usually require a WiFi connection to 
access the Internet. 

Smartphones appear to be more up for the task, and especially with the new T-Mobile G1 and 
Palm\registered Pre they have really taken off. However, their lack of specialization for the user 
group we target makes them just a tad too difficult to use to be a real alternative. 
Focusing on a limited feature-set, we were able to create something more accessible, smaller and 
faster, feats the aforementioned devices cannot posses while keeping their more general approach to 
mobile computing.
