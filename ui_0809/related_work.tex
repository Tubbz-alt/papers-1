There is the Palm Pre, the T-Mobile G1 (possibly even G2) and something we like to call ``MacBook pro''.
However, all of the mentioned produces (except for the G2, maybe, but that remains unknown), are really second class
compared to the SocioPath and actually not worth mentioning. Our main advantage: The SocioPath is smaller.
But this goes hand in hand with our biggest drawback: Our screen is very tiny and you might have to get real close
when watching photos.
