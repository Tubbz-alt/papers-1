With the rise of the Web 2.0 social networking sites, our social interactions
have gained another facet. As with every social activity, a confinement
to a lone computer session cannot be the end of it, if the social web is 
to persists. However, ubiquitous use of social networks on-the-go using 
the increasingly popular smartphones is held back by the large form factor of 
those devices, and the fact that they are not specialized to perform this 
task. In this paper, we propose a tiny mobile device tailored to the needs 
of the social web user. In our user study, participants were able to access
their most wanted features more quickly and with less error compared to a 
regular smartphone with a web browser.
