With the rise of the Web 2.0 social networking sites, our social interactions
have gained another facet. As with every social activity, confinement
to a lone computer session thins out the user-group considerably.
If the social web is 
to persists this cannot be the end of the story. Yet, broad use of social networks on-the-go 
with the help of
the increasingly popular smartphones is held back by the large form factor of 
those devices, and the fact that they are not specialized to perform this 
task. In this paper, we propose a tiny mobile device tailored to the needs 
of the social web user. In our user study, participants were able to access
their most wanted features more quickly and with less error compared to a 
regular smartphone with a web browser.
