\section{Conclusions}
%
We have shown that basic social networking is possible even on very restricted 
device dimensions and with minimal learning effort required by the user. 
Our studies and questionnaires prove that a demand for such specialized 
devices can be observed and that current solutions are deemed insufficient 
by the target group. While we could not address each wish of our study 
participants or rectify each flaw of the competing options for using 
a social networking site, we succeeded in creating a device capable of 
solving the most dire problems of current solutions. We believe, devices 
such as the \emph{SocioPath} will in the very near future be created for 
many aspects of the modern live and that they will bring us a lot closer 
to full filling the high hopes set in ubiquitous computing and wide-spread 
access to world-wide information networks.
