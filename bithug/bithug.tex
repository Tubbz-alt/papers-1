\begin{abstract}
  This paper describes some of the design decisions taken in creating
  the \emph{Bithug Coding Social} web service. Bithug is a free, highly 
  configurable and social code hosting service created during the ``Social 
  Web Applications Engineering'' seminar at HPI in 2009/10. Its purpose is to 
  provide a free and more versatile alternative to the git hosting 
  site \emph{Github} for universities and companies internal code hosting needs.

\section{Introduction}
The increased interactivity of the Web 2.0 has in recent years brought about a 
shift in web technologies. One aspect of this shift is the increasing generation
of content by the consumer, clearly recognizable in the popularity of social 
networks.

In 2007, the classic generators of content on the web, the programmers, got 
their own social network where they could show off their interests and skills: 
the social coding site \emph{Github}\cite{github:www}. On Github, a user can 
create code repositories and freely share code with everyone else on the network.
Other users or projects can be ``followed'' which means, that every action on 
and by the followee is reported in a feed (on page and via RSS). Commits
can be commented on, people can collaborate on projects and code is online and 
browseable.
All repositories on Github are initially open, however, for a monthly fee you 
can buy private space on Github where only people who have been explicitely 
granted access can view code.

\section{Project Management as a Service}
Bithug, as an alternative code hosting service, intends to focus on the people 
behind the code. That means, common hosting features such as forking and creating 
repositories are made possible, but the most rewarding features lie in notifying 
the people involved in a project and giving them a platform to communicate on. As 
people and projects are be highly diverse, we intend to offer and integrate a 
number of webservices, authentication methods and repository settings.

\section{Technical Stuff}

\subsection{The Stack}
Our project split into three major subprojects: Bithug (out actual project), BigBand (parts of Bithug you can use in any Sinatra Project), MonkeyLib (parts you can use in any Ruby project).

Patched versions of krb5-auth (currently unmaintained) and Ohm.

Other libraries we use: ...

Stack is known to work on ...

\subsection{Sinatra}
Sinatra vs. Rails/Merb/Redis
Complexity, enforcing usage, code generation sucks.

\subsection{Using dynamic Inheritance as means of configuration}
Mixins and stuff
