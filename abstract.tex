During the course Software Architecture we 
attended to in the semestre 2008/09 we 
implemented a clone of the popular ``Frozen-Bubble''
open-source game using object-oriented techinques 
and the Squeak implementation of Smalltalk.
Our clone is not simple copy though, it exceeds 
the original in extensibility and style. How we 
achieved this is the concern of this paper.
