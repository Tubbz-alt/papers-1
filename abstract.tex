During the course Software Architecture we 
attended to in the semester 2008/09 we 
implemented a clone of the popular ``Frozen-Bubble''
open-source game using object-oriented techniques 
and the Squeak implementation of Smalltalk.
Our clone is not simple copy though, it was 
designed for flexible themability and
a more challenging game mechanics.
