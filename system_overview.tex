\section{Complete System Overview}

The theme class is implemented as flyweight, holding references to previously 
created instances of a particular theme. If a requested theme type is not yet 
held in the list of instances, the class calls a builder class, 
FBThemeBuilder~\ref{fig:system}, to parse the requested theme's XML file, 
load the images and then return a fresh instance of the theme.
