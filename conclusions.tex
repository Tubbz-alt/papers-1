\section{Conclusions}
We managed to build a functional and flexible FrozenBubble clone for Morphic,
but given our time constraints, not all features we would have liked to implement
made it into the final version. Especially a working network multiplayer mode would
have been quite delightful. It is possible however to play a local multiplayer mode,
limited in use only through the obnoxious keypress messages provided by morphic.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
We are indebted to the developers of Frozen Bubble for allowing us to release 
our clone with the name and graphics of the original game under the MIT 
license. We also thank Professor Hirschfeld, Tobias Pape and Michael Perscheid for 
their advice.
