\section{Conclusions}
We managed to build a functional and flexible FrozenBubble clone for Morphic,
but given our time constraints, not all features we would have liked to implement
made it into the final version. Especially a working network multiplayer mode would
have been quite delightful. It is possible however to play a local multiplayer mode,
limited in use only by the self-blocking keypress messages provided by morphic.\\
Several schemes and patterns helped us to achieve our goals, especially the git version
control system, modelling the system components before actually coding and the simple 
and intuitive smalltalk language along with the Squeak environment, especially the class
browser.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
We are indebted to the developers of Frozen Bubble for allowing us to release 
our clone with the name and graphics of the original game under the MIT 
license. We also thank Professor Hirschfeld, Tobias Pape and Michael Perscheid for 
their advice.
